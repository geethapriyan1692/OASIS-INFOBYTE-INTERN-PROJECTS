## Unemployment Analysis Project
## Project Overview
This project aims to analyze unemployment data and derive insights using various data analysis and visualization techniques. The dataset includes information on estimated unemployment rates, employed numbers, and labor participation rates across different regions and areas.

## Dataset
The dataset consists of the following columns:

Date: Date of the record.
Region: Region where the data was collected.
Area: Specific area within the region.
Estimated Unemployment Rate (%): Estimated unemployment rate as a percentage.
Estimated Employed: Number of employed individuals.
Estimated Labour Participation Rate (%): Estimated labor participation rate as a percentage.

## Data Preprocessing
Checked for missing and duplicate values.
Dropped duplicate rows.
Displayed summary statistics.
Encoded categorical variables if necessary.
Scaled numerical features for uniformity.

## Data Visualization
Correlation Analysis
Generated a correlation matrix heatmap to understand the relationships between numerical variables.
Plotted individual scatter plots and pair plots to visualize relationships between variables.

## Distribution of Categorical Data
Bar plots to show the distribution of unemployment across different areas.
Pie chart to show the estimated unemployment rate by region.
Box plots to display the distribution of employed numbers and unemployment rates.
Distribution of Numerical Data
Histograms to show the frequency distribution of labor participation rates.
Bar plots to display unemployment rates by region.
Box plots to compare unemployment rates by area.
Violin plots to show the distribution of labor participation rates by area.
Contingency Tables
Created contingency tables to examine the relationship between different categorical variables.

## Summary Statistics
Displayed summary statistics to understand the distribution of numerical features.
Generated tables to show unique value counts for each column.

## Feature Engineering
Selected and processed categorical columns.
Encoded categorical variables using appropriate encoding techniques.
Scaled numerical features using standard scaling methods.

## Conclusion
The analysis provides a comprehensive overview of unemployment rates, labor participation rates, and the distribution of employment across different regions and areas. Visualizations and correlation analyses help in understanding the key factors affecting unemployment rates.
